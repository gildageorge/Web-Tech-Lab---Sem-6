        <h4><b>Career Objective</b></h4>
        <p>A Career Objective or a Resume Objective is essentially a heading statement that describes your
            professional goals in two to three sentences. Employers looking to hire an employee for a position tend
            to seek candidates that are driven enough to understand what they want.</p>
